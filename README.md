# matplotlib-challenge

For the Matplotlib challenge the task was to analyse and display graphs based on the performance over a 45 day period of 9 drug regimens and one placebo to combat cancereous tumors in  mice. The drug regimen to look closely at was Capomulin.

Analysis consisted of calculuating the mean, median, variance, standard deviation and standard error of mean of the tumor size over this period. It was also important to find any potential outliers in the final tumor size. One particular analysis was to dertmine whether the weight is correlated with tumor size.

Graphs included bar charts, pie charts, line charts, boxplots and scatterplots.
